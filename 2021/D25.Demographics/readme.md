Population projection for Venezuela.

![Line chart that shows the number of people living in Venezuela from 1950 to 2020. 
After 2020 it shows the population projections made by the United Nations. Points of interest: 
in 2015 there were 30 million people living in Venezuela, in 2020 there were 28 million people living in the country. 
This sudden change in the population is due to the mass migrations the country suffered during the five year gap. 
The projectio has 3 variants: high variant 53 million people by 2100, medium variant 34 million people by 2100 
and low variant 21 million people by 2100.](https://github.com/luisfrein/-30DayChartChallenge/blob/master/D25.Demographics/D25.Demographics.png)
