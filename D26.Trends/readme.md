Global shark attacks are rising!

![Line chart that goes from 1990 to 2016, and shows the trend of fatal (in orange)
and non-fatal (in green) global shark attacks. The chart shows that non-fatal attacks 
have been raising from around 28 in 1990 to around 124 in 2016. Fatal cases have been staying 
relatively the same, less than 25 attacks every year. The lines for each group also has a shadow
that shows the 95, 80 and 50 confidence interval. Dots were also plotted and they show the exact number 
of cases for each year.](https://github.com/luisfrein/-30DayChartChallenge/blob/master/D26.Trends/D26.Trends.png)
